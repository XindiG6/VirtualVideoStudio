# DevelopAVirtualVideoStudio

Oregon State University capstone group 8 presents Develop a Virtual Video Studio.

With the continuous development of virtual reality, many movies have begun to use computer software to shape virtual shooting scenes, but the skill required and cost of this software is too high to be suitable for amateur videographers. This project is focused on developing software to meet the desire of people with less funding and experience and aims to reduce costs as much as possible so that it is affordable for amateur users.
